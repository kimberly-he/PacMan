#1. Purpose:
      This assignment's purpose is using differnt and effective algorithms to make ghosts smater to catch the CMPTman.
            Algorithms should be able to use in all testboards.(So,it can't be an algorithm that ghost move in a fixed route)
	          
		  #2. Basic idea:
		        *1. algorithm 1: Basic function!
			                                                          
										                         Initialize possible directions on the exact corresponding position. Delete the impossible direction(BLOCK,our of board).
													                        For instance,the N is out of board,W is BLOCK,so the initialized direction of this point is [S,E].
																                                                          
																							                         It's like a 3-dimension list - road(global variable can use everywhere),stores directions correspongding to the position
																										                        [ [[0,0],[0,1],...,[0,h]] , [[1,0],[1,1],...,[1,h]] ,..., [[w,0],[w,1],...,[w,h]] ].

																													                       Thus, if we want position(j,k) direction, we type road[j][k].
																															                                                                 
																																							       *2. algorithm 2: Linear-chase function.:

																																							                              Suppose ghost move(after initial direction),calculate the linear distance between the CMPTman and the ghost.

																																										                             Append the distance to a list,copy and sort it.
																																													                         
																																																                        Find the shortest distance and make that direction move.
																																																			                                                          
																																																										                         When multiple ghosts run into each other,turn to function random-chase to separate them!I don't want they just stupid move together.
																																																													                                                           
																																																																				         *3. algorithm 3: Random-chase function:
																																																																					          
																																																																						                         If ghost number <=2, just do linear-chase function.Since random mode somehow making ghost look lazy.
																																																																									                                                           
																																																																																                          If ghost number >=3, choose one ghost to do random-chase function is efficient since it can be a potential threat.

																																																																																			                         Attention: When the distance of CMPTman and ghost < 6 (6 doesn't have special meaning, I just want to choose numbers
																																																																																						                        indicating CMPTman and ghost are close), ghost should turn to linear-chase function since it sucks if ghost turn back
																																																																																									                       when it almost can get CMPTman!

																																																																																											       #3. Known problems:
																																																																																											             *1. I try not to stuck ghost into corner, but it still stupid stuck back and forth instead of resting.
																																																																																												           *2. Linear-chase is not the beat way to chase, the ghost always think itself close to CMPTman when there actually a wall between them,
																																																																																													             the best way should be overcome the wall.
																																																																																														           *3. Multiple ghosts always gather together to move making the chase less efficient and existing.                                                   
																																																																																															         *4. Prediction is quite difficult especially when the textboard is vary.
